# Year 2018: Go Lang

I've played with Go Lang some, so this year all my spare time will be spent using Go.

## Why?

DevOps or automation is something I've done as a big part of my career over the years. It seems that Go lang is well suited for this. Also... Docker, Kubernetes use it so I'd like to understand it better.
